# like multi-level tree vs single-level tree of multiple_series.py

# 1. read input from user into sectors
# 2. perform analysis from multiple_series.py on each sector to derive weights
# 3. perform analysis from multiple_series.py on the group of sectors

# cross analyzing stocks of same sector
# taking min()/max() of each indicator for a sector, averaging out
# using pat_papertrade.py for each stock, weights between are trained by multiple_series.py
